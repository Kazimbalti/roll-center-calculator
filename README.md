# Roll Center Calculator

>> add an Image "RollCenterApp"

About the submission:
This submission contains a set of the .mlapp file and the .m function files to calculate the roll-center height.
The model is built for the student teams participating in the automotive competitions.
The teams can use this app as a reference to find the better connecting position of their suspension by checking the distance between the roll center position and the center of gravity.

## Roll Center Point depends on suspension geometry
